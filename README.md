# "End Card" PCBs for OreSat

OreSat cards in the top position (#1) and bottom position (#20) are special because they interface with
both the solar arrays and with the end caps. They also tend to hold deployable antennas.

## Features

- 4 solar panel connectors
- 3 available RF connectors
- Alternative backplane connectors only (since the solar panel connectors take up the main connector spot)

## Connector information

- TBD.
